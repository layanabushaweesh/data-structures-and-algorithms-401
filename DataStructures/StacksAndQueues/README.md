# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

the challenges is to build a queue data structure behavior for a Pseudo Queue class using two Stacks instead of using front and rear parameters as in queue. 
the results of enqueue and dequeue in the Pseudo Queue should be the same process in Queue.

## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
[whiteboard](pesodu.md)
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
for enqueue(value) i used push method from stack class
for dequeue()  i used push & pop method from stack class

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
