# problem domain
Write which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key,
and return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key,
 or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Whiteboard Process

# Approach & Efficiency

we will write a function that will loop through the array and divide the array into two half 
and check for the index for separate value
 if it is found and return it , if it didn't found return -1
