# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called fizz buzz tree

Arguments: k-ary tree
Return: new k-ary tree
Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values changed as follows:
1- the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
2-the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
3-the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
4-the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
